## Overview

Welcome to the DBMS Practice repository! This project serves as a practical environment for learning, experimenting, and honing skills related to Database Management Systems (DBMS) by simulating a basic **E-commerce Database**. It focuses on relational database concepts, SQL query practice, database design principles, and implementing core DBMS features within the context of managing customers, products, and orders. This repository provides a foundation for exploring data modeling, query optimization, and transaction management.

## Features

This repository is designed to support the implementation and practice of various DBMS features within an e-commerce context:

*   **üßë‚Äçüíº Data Modeling:** Designing and implementing database schemas (Conceptual, Logical, Physical) for customers, products, orders, and line items.
*   **‚öôÔ∏è SQL Querying:** Practicing basic to advanced SQL commands (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, JOINs, Subqueries, Aggregations, Window Functions) relevant to e-commerce reporting (e.g., finding top customers, calculating sales totals).
*   **‚ûï Data Manipulation:** Adding, updating, and deleting records for customers, products, and orders.
*   **üìä Indexing & Optimization:** Understanding and applying indexing strategies (e.g., on foreign keys, frequently queried columns) to improve query performance for typical e-commerce lookups.
*   **üîí Transaction Management:** Implementing transactions to ensure atomicity for operations like placing an order (updating stock, creating order record).
*   **üîÑ Backup & Recovery:** Practicing basic database backup and recovery procedures (using tools like `pg_dump`).
*   **üîê Basic Access Control:** Exploring user roles and permissions within PostgreSQL (if desired).
*   **üìà Reporting:** Generating sample reports, such as total sales per product or orders per customer, using SQL.

## Technical Details

*   **Programming Languages:** Python üêç (for scripting/application logic), SQL üìä (for database interaction)
*   **Database System:** PostgreSQL üêò (Version 12+ recommended)
*   **Tools & Technologies:** Git üêô (for version control), SQLAlchemy (optional, for ORM interaction), DBeaver or pgAdmin (optional, for GUI database management)
*   **Operating System:** Cross-platform (Linux üêß, Windows üíª, macOS üçé)

## System Architecture (Optional)

This project primarily focuses on the database layer. It can be interacted with directly via SQL clients or through simple Python scripts. A potential extension could involve building a simple client-server application (e.g., using Flask/Django) that interacts with this database, creating a 3-Tier architecture üè¢üè¢üè¢.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project environment on your local machine for development and practice purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

*   Python 3.8+ üêç
*   PostgreSQL Server (Version 12 or higher recommended) üêò
*   Git üêô
*   `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

A step-by-step guide to get your development environment running:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/M-Mikran-Sandhu/DBMS-Practice.git
    cd DBMS-Practice
    ```
2.  **Set up the PostgreSQL Database:**
    *   Connect to your PostgreSQL server (e.g., using `psql`).
    *   Create a new database for this project:
        ```sql
        CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_practice;
        ```
    *   Create a dedicated user (optional but recommended):
        ```sql
        CREATE USER practice_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_strong_password';
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE ecommerce_practice TO practice_user;
        ```
    *   Connect to the new database (`\c ecommerce_practice`) and run the schema creation script (assuming you create a `schema.sql` file based on the diagram below):
        ```bash
        psql -U practice_user -d ecommerce_practice -a -f schema.sql 
        # You might need to provide the host and prompt for password depending on your setup
        ```
3.  **Configure Environment (if using Python scripts):**
    *   Create a virtual environment (recommended):
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
        ```
    *   Create a `.env` file (copy from a potential `.env.example`) and add your database connection details:
        ```plaintext
        DB_NAME=ecommerce_practice
        DB_USER=practice_user
        DB_PASSWORD=your_strong_password
        DB_HOST=localhost
        DB_PORT=5432 
        ```
4.  **Install Python Dependencies (if any):**
    *   If you have a `requirements.txt` file (e.g., for SQLAlchemy or psycopg2):
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        *(You might need `pip install psycopg2-binary sqlalchemy python-dotenv` initially)*

5.  **Run Practice Scripts/Connect:**
    *   You can now connect to the `ecommerce_practice` database using a SQL client (like DBeaver, pgAdmin, or `psql`) with the `practice_user` credentials.
    *   If you create Python scripts (e.g., `populate_data.py`, `run_reports.py`), run them:
        ```bash
        python your_script_name.py
        ```

## Usage

Examples of how to interact with the database:

*   **Connecting via `psql`:**
    ```bash
    psql -U practice_user -d ecommerce_practice -h localhost
    ```
*   **Running SQL Queries (within `psql` or a GUI tool):**
    ```sql
    -- Find all customers
    SELECT * FROM customer;

    -- Find total quantity ordered for each product
    SELECT p.name, SUM(li.quantity) AS total_quantity_ordered
    FROM product p
    JOIN line_item li ON p.product_id = li.product_id
    GROUP BY p.name
    ORDER BY total_quantity_ordered DESC;
    ```
*   **Using Python Scripts (Example):**
    ```bash
    # Example: Populate database with sample data
    python scripts/populate_sample_data.py 

    # Example: Generate a sales report
    python scripts/generate_sales_report.py --month 2024-05
    ```
    *(These script names are examples; you would need to create them.)*

## Database Schema

The database schema defines the structure for managing customers, products, orders, and line items.

*   **Diagrams:** A visual representation (ERD) of the schema:
    ```mermaid
    erDiagram
        CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
        ORDER ||--|{ LINE_ITEM : contains
        PRODUCT ||--o{ LINE_ITEM : ordered_in

        CUSTOMER {
            int customer_id PK "SERIAL"
            varchar name
            varchar email UNIQUE
            text address
            timestamp created_at
        }
        ORDER {
            int order_id PK "SERIAL"
            int customer_id FK
            timestamp order_date
            varchar status
        }
        LINE_ITEM {
            int order_id PK, FK
            int product_id PK, FK
            int quantity
            decimal price_per_unit "At time of order"
        }
        PRODUCT {
            int product_id PK "SERIAL"
            varchar name
            text description
            decimal current_price
            int stock_quantity
        }
    ```
    *(This Mermaid diagram represents the intended schema. Ensure your `schema.sql` file implements this structure, potentially adding constraints like NOT NULL, CHECK, etc.)*

*   **Text Description:**
    *   `CUSTOMER`: Stores customer information (unique ID, name, unique email, address, creation timestamp).
    *   `PRODUCT`: Stores product details (unique ID, name, description, current price, stock level).
    *   `ORDER`: Stores order header information (unique ID, customer reference, date, status like 'pending', 'shipped').
    *   `LINE_ITEM`: Represents the items within an order (links Order and Product, stores quantity and the price paid per unit at the time of the order).
    *   **Relationships:** Customers place Orders. Orders contain Line Items. Line Items refer to Products.
